# Chemi-Craft

Welcome to **Chemi-Craft**! This is a 3D educational game built in Unity that allows players to explore chemical equations interactively. The game features 17 chemical elements, and players can learn and test their knowledge by solving chemical equations through engaging gameplay.

## How the Game Works

1. **Choosing Elements:**
   - Players start by choosing the elements they need for their chemical equation.
   - If the chosen equation involves elements not included in the game's initial 17 elements, the player must first acquire 3D assets or models of the missing elements. These assets should be correctly integrated into the game environment.

2. **Equation Video:**
   - Once the player has selected the elements, a video demonstrating the chemical equation is shown. This video helps the player visualize the reaction and understand the process better.

3. **Quiz Section:**
   - After watching the video, the player is presented with at least 5 questions related to the equation. The questions are designed to test the player's understanding of the chemical process and the elements involved.

## How to Add New Elements

If your equation involves elements that are not part of the initial 17 elements in the game, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain 3D Models:**
   - Find or create 3D models for the missing elements. Ensure the models are accurate and compatible with the Unity engine.

2. **Import the Models:**
   - Import the 3D models into the Unity project. Make sure they are correctly textured and animated if necessary.

3. **Integrate into the Game:**
   - Add the new elements to the game's database. Ensure they can be selected by the player and interact correctly with the existing elements.

4. **Video Requirements:**
   - Create or source a video that clearly explains the chemical equation involving the new elements. The video should be educational and easy to understand.

5. **Quiz Questions:**
   - Prepare at least 5 questions related to the new equation. These questions will appear after the video and should challenge the player's knowledge of the equation and its components.
